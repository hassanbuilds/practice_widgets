// Q1: AlertDialog Example
// Requirements:
// - Create a StatefulWidget with a button "Delete Item"
// - When pressed, show an AlertDialog asking "Are you sure you want to delete this item?"
// - The dialog should have two buttons: "Cancel" (just close dialog) and "Delete" (show a print message in console)
// - After closing the dialog, return back to the main screen
